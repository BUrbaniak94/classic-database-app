# Classic database App

This is simple Spring boot apllication containing  Spring JPA and Spring Rest Controllers.  
I writed test for one of controllers to check methods POST, GET and DELETE using JUnit, AssertJ and Mockito. 

The application schema is based on classic database from mysql tutorial.
